Overview (out-of-date)
============

Nerdware is a powerful, consistent, and flexible ecommerce
platform. Built using the [RainTpl](https://github.com/feulf/raintpl3and) and [Slim](https://www.slimframework.com) frameworks, Nerdware provides a
simple yet highly extensible architecture that encourages companies to start selling Online.

Nerdware is different. Unlike many other platforms that make extensive use of modules or reusable applications, Nerdware provides most of its
functionality by default. This approach yields a more integrated and efficient platform.
